## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document describes the software architecture and design of **BarchScan**, a two-tier SaaS platform for digitizing physical logbook records and analyzing operational data. It serves as the single source of truth for understanding the system's structure, data flow, component responsibilities, interfaces, and design rationale.

### 1.2 Scope

BarchScan addresses the problem of converting handwritten or printed logbook pages into structured, searchable, editable digital data — and then turning that data into actionable intelligence. The system:

- Accepts photographs of logbook pages (camera capture or file upload).
- Uses AI-powered vision models to extract structured tabular data from the images.
- Provides a guided edit workflow — the AI suggests table structure, users review, edit (insert/delete/rename rows & columns), and click "Create".
- Persists all data with end-to-end encryption (AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit).
- Provides a spreadsheet-like interface for viewing, editing, exporting, and managing the data (**Tier 1: Records Vault** — $8/month).
- Offers an integrated Intelligence Engine with manual and AI-assisted analytics, external data upload, chat-based tagging, and report generation (**Tier 2** — $23/month).

### 1.3 Terminology Note

BarchScan operates on **Records** — a deliberately broad term. A "record" is any structured physical document: a logbook, a register, a patrol sheet, an inspection form, a lab notebook, a stock count, or any tabular paper document. This is intentional: the platform serves any sector that generates paper-based structured data.

### 1.4 Intended Audience

- Developers maintaining or extending BarchScan.
- Stakeholders reviewing the system design.
- New contributors onboarding to the codebase.

### 1.5 Definitions

| Term                  | Definition                                                                                          |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Record                | Any physical structured document digitized via BarchScan (logbooks, registers, forms, etc.).        |
| Ingestion             | The process of uploading and extracting data from a logbook image.                                  |
| Records Vault            | Tier 1 product — the encrypted digital archive at `/data` for storing, retrieving, and managing records. |
| Intelligence Engine | Tier 2 product — manual + AI-assisted analytics suite with data upload and chat-based insights.      |
| Schema Context        | The set of existing column headers and a sample row sent to the AI model to maintain consistency across extractions. |
| Analytics Session     | An isolated, encrypted AI analytics context with a unique session ID per user.                      |
| Tagged Reference      | A user-applied tag on a record set or dataset that the AI assistant can reference in chat.          |
| External Data Upload  | A user-supplied CSV, Excel, or JSON file uploaded to the Intelligence Engine for analysis.          |

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 Problem Statement

Organizations that maintain physical records — operations logs, attendance registers, inspection sheets, compliance forms, inventory counts — need a fast, accurate way to digitize and analyze this data without manual entry. Existing tools fail because:

- Generic OCR lacks contextual intelligence for tabular, handwritten data.
- Enterprise digitization suites are priced out of reach for most organizations.
- No solution combines capture + human review + encrypted storage + analytics in one affordable platform.

### 2.2 Solution

BarchScan combines a mobile-optimized capture interface with Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash vision model to intelligently extract structured data from photographed pages. The system operates as a **two-tier SaaS platform**:

**Tier 1 — Records Vault ($8/month)**:
1. Learns the schema from previously ingested records.
2. Applies that schema context to new extractions for consistency.
3. AI suggests table structure; users edit (insert, rename, delete rows/columns) and click "Create".
4. Deduplicates incoming rows against the existing dataset.
5. Encrypts and stores all data with AES-256 encryption.
6. Provides full-featured data management interface for retrieval and documentation.

**Tier 2 — Intelligence Engine ($23/month)**:
1. Everything in Tier 1.
2. Users can upload external datasets (CSV, Excel, JSON) for analysis.
3. AI model is connected to all user data — users tag and reference (@mention) specific datasets in chat.
4. Manual analytics: chart builders, pivot tables, filters, formulas.
5. AI-assisted analytics: trend detection, anomaly detection, pattern recognition.
6. Business report generation (PDF) — business plans, compliance reports, data summaries.
7. All data encrypted end-to-end with session-level isolation.

### 3.2 Tier 1 — Records Vault

The Records Vault tier is the foundational digitization and storage product. The core workflow is:

```
SCAN → AI SUGGESTION → USER EDITS → CREATE → ENCRYPTED VAULT → RETRIEVAL
```

Key responsibilities:
- Mobile-optimized image capture (camera or gallery).
- AI-powered table extraction with schema consistency across pages.
- **Suggestion Step**: Human-in-the-loop review. User can insert rows, delete rows, add columns, delete columns, rename column headers, and edit individual cells before committing.
- Encrypted data storage (AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit).
- Retrieval interface with search, filter, sort, and export.

### 3.3 Tier 2 — Intelligence Engine

The Intelligence Engine builds on the Records Vault with a world-class analytics layer. It is designed to grow from basic summaries to complex, production-grade statistical analysis over time.

#### 3.3.1 AI Analytics Assistant

An embedded AI assistant (Gemini with function calling + MCP tools) integrated into the analytics workspace:

- Has access to **all** of the user's digitized records and uploaded data simultaneously.
- Supports **tagging**: users apply tags to record sets, date ranges, or uploaded files. Tags are referenced in chat using `@tagname` (e.g., `@patrol-june`, `@q2-inspections`, `@uploaded-inventory`).
- Generates contextually appropriate charts, tables, and visualizations on demand.
- Communicates through a dedicated chat panel within the analytics page.
- Operates within an isolated, encrypted session with a unique session ID managed by BarchScan.
- Uses embedded MCP tools to sort, filter, group, and render structured data directly within the chat thread.

#### 3.3.2 External Data Upload

Tier 2 users can upload their own external data files into the Intelligence Engine:

- **Supported formats**: CSV, Excel (.xlsx), JSON.
- Uploaded data is treated as a first-class source alongside scanned records.
- The AI assistant has full access to uploaded files for analysis, comparison, and cross-referencing.
- Uploaded data can be tagged and referenced in chat like any other dataset.
- All uploaded data is encrypted at rest under the same model as scanned records.
- Upload is managed via the `upload-data` API endpoint with user-scoped storage.

#### 3.3.3 Manual Analytics

User-controlled analytics tools for hands-on data analysis:

- Custom chart builder: bar, line, pie, scatter, heatmap.
- Pivot tables with drag-and-drop configuration.
- Advanced filters and grouping.
- Formula engine.
- Custom saved views and dashboards.
- Range from basic (totals, averages) to complex (regression, correlation, statistical outlier detection).

#### 3.3.4 MCP-Embedded Tools

The AI assistant has embedded tool capabilities that allow it to operate on data programmatically within the chat:

- Sort datasets by any field in ascending or descending order.
- Filter records by user-specified criteria (natural language → structured query).
- Group and aggregate data (sum, average, count, min, max by category).
- Render structured results as formatted tables or charts within the chat thread.
- Cross-reference multiple sources (scanned records + uploaded files + tagged subsets).



---

### 3.4 Session Management & Isolation

Every user session is managed by BarchScan:

- A unique session ID is generated per user per analytics session.
- Session state (AI context, active data sources, conversation history) is encrypted.
- Sessions are completely isolated between users at the infrastructure level.
- Session IDs are visible to users for trust, transparency, and support traceability.
- Sessions can be saved, resumed, or terminated by the user.

---

## 4. Architecture

### 4.1 Architectural Style

BarchScan uses a **serverless client-server architecture** with a **two-tier SaaS model**:

- **Frontend**: Static HTML/CSS/JS served from Vercel's CDN. No build step, no framework (evolving to React/Next.js for analytics).
- **Backend**: Vercel Serverless Functions (Node.js, ESM) acting as stateless API handlers.
- **Data**: Fully managed external services (Supabase for structured data + auth + encryption, Cloudinary for image assets).
- **AI**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for both vision extraction and analytics intelligence.
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit, per-user key derivation.

### 4.2 Design Principles

| Principle                    | How It's Applied                                                                                          |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Zero-infrastructure**      | No servers or containers to manage. Fully PaaS/SaaS-hosted.                                               |
| **Mobile-first**             | The capture page is optimized for phone cameras — the primary input device.                               |
| **Schema consistency**       | Every extraction is schema-aware: AI receives existing headers + sample row as context.                   |
| **Human-in-the-loop**        | AI suggests; user confirms. No data is committed without user review in the Suggestion Step.              |
| **Idempotent ingestion**     | Deduplication at commit time prevents duplicate records.                                                  |
| **Encrypted by default**     | All user data is AES-256 encrypted at rest and TLS 1.3 in transit. No opt-out.                           |
| **Tenant isolation**         | Supabase Row-Level Security ensures each user's data is isolated at the database query level.             |
| **Session-scoped analytics** | Every analytics session has a unique ID. AI context is encrypted and isolated per user per session.       |
| **Progressive disclosure**   | Capture page is minimal. Analytics workspace reveals depth progressively.                                 |

### 4.3 Technology Stack

| Layer        | Technology                                    | Rationale                                    |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Frontend     | Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript → React/Next.js | No build step initially; evolving for analytics |
| Backend      | Vercel Serverless Functions (Node.js 18+, ESM)| Zero-config, auto-scaling, global edge       |
| AI Engine    | Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (`@google/generative-ai`) | Vision extraction + analytics intelligence |
| Database     | Supabase (PostgreSQL + Row-Level Security)    | Scalable, encrypted, multi-tenant            |
| Image Store  | Cloudinary                                    | CDN-backed image management with transforms  |
| Encryption   | AES-256-GCM + TLS 1.3 + per-user keys         | End-to-end data protection                   |
| Auth         | Supabase Auth (email, OAuth)                  | User accounts, session management            |
| Payments     | Stripe Billing                                | Subscription management for two tiers        |
| Form Parsing | `formidable` v3                               | Battle-tested multipart form parsing         |
| Routing      | `vercel.json`                                 | Declarative routing, rewrites, redirects     |

### 5.2 Backend Components (Serverless API)

All API handlers: `export default async function handler(req, res)` on Vercel.

Every handler validates the Supabase JWT before processing any data.

#### 5.2.1 `process-record` — AI Extraction (Suggestion Step)

**File**: `api/process-record.js`

Orchestrates AI extraction and returns a **suggestion** — does NOT save data.

```
POST /api/process-record
        │
        ▼
1. Verify Supabase JWT
        │
        ▼
2. Parse image (formidable)
        │
        ▼
3. Fetch schema context from Supabase
   (user's existing headers + sample row)
        │
        ▼
4. Build schema-aware prompt
        │
        ▼
5. Call Gemini 2.5 Flash (image + prompt)
        │
        ▼
6. Parse JSON from model response
   (multi-layer: find boundaries → strip
    trailing commas → fallback sanitize)
        │
        ▼
7. Return suggestion to frontend
   *** DATA IS NOT SAVED ***
        │
        ▼
[User reviews in Suggestion Step Table Editor]
[User inserts/deletes rows, adds/removes columns,
 renames headers, edits cells]
        │
        ▼ [CREATE clicked]
8. Frontend POSTs confirmed data
   → commit-record endpoint
```

#### 5.2.2 `commit-record` — Confirmed Data Persistence

**File**: `api/commit-record.js`

Receives user-confirmed (and potentially edited) table data and persists it.

```
POST /api/commit-record
        │
        ▼
1. Verify Supabase JWT
        │
        ▼
2. Validate payload (array of objects)
        │
        ▼
3. Deduplicate against existing user records
   (≤1 field difference = duplicate)
        │
        ▼
4. Encrypt record data (AES-256-GCM,
   user-scoped key)
        │
        ▼
5. INSERT into Supabase (user_id scoped,
   RLS enforced)
        │
        ▼
6. Return updated record set to frontend
```

#### 5.2.3 Supporting API Handlers

| Handler              | File                          | Logic Summary                                                                        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `get-records`        | `api/get-records.js`          | Authenticated GET. Fetches user's records from Supabase (RLS-scoped). Decrypts.      |
| `update-records`     | `api/update-records.js`       | Accepts full record array, validates, encrypts, and overwrites user's Supabase rows. |
| `clear-vault`        | `api/clear-vault.js`          | Deletes all records for the authenticated user. Confirmation-gated.                  |
| `upload-data`        | `api/upload-data.js`          | *(Tier 2)* Accepts CSV/Excel/JSON file. Parses, encrypts, stores in Supabase as a named data source for the user. |
| `analytics-query`    | `api/analytics-query.js`      | *(Tier 2)* Executes structured analytics queries (filter, group, aggregate) across user's records + uploaded data. |
| `analytics-chat`     | `api/analytics-chat.js`       | *(Tier 2)* Streams Gemini response with function calling. Resolves @tag references, calls MCP tools, returns AI response + rendered data. |
| `manage-session`     | `api/manage-session.js`       | *(Tier 2)* Create, retrieve, save, or terminate an analytics session. Returns session ID. |
| `validate-session`   | `api/validate-session.js`     | Verifies Supabase JWT and checks user's active tier (Tier 1 or Tier 2) against Stripe. |
| `cloudinary-images`  | `api/cloudinary-images.js`    | Lists up to 50 resources from user's Cloudinary folder. Returns metadata.            |
| `delete-image`       | `api/delete-image.js`         | Deletes a Cloudinary resource by `public_id`.                                        |
| `reprocess-images`   | `api/reprocess-images.js`     | Fetches image from Cloudinary, sends to `process-record` for re-extraction.          |
| `stripe-webhook`     | `api/stripe-webhook.js`       | Handles Stripe billing events: subscription created, upgraded, cancelled, payment failed. Updates user tier in Supabase. |

| `status`        | text      | `active`, `saved`, `terminated`                |

### 8.2 Record Data Format

Each record row is stored as an encrypted JSON object. Decrypted, it looks like:

```json
{
  "Date": "15/06/2026",
  "Time": "08:30",
  "Officer Name": "J. Doe",
  "Vessel": "MV Pacific Star",
  "Activity": "Arrival inspection",
  "Remarks": "All clear"
}
```

- **Dynamic schema**: Columns are inferred by AI from the first record image. Maintained via schema context.
- **No primary key within data**: Deduplication relies on fuzzy field-by-field comparison at commit time.
- **Flat structure**: No nested objects or arrays.
- **Null handling**: Missing or illegible values are `null`.

### 8.3 Encryption Model

All user data (`records.data`, `data_sources.data`, `analytics_sessions.context`) is encrypted before storage:

```
plaintext JSON
      │
      ▼
AES-256-GCM encryption
  key = PBKDF2(user_secret, salt, 100000 iterations, SHA-256)
  IV = random 12 bytes per record
      │
      ▼
{ iv: <base64>, ciphertext: <base64>, tag: <base64> }
      │
      ▼
stored in Supabase jsonb column
```

- User secret is derived from user credentials + server-side pepper (`ENCRYPTION_PEPPER` env var).
- Key rotation is supported by re-encrypting with a new key on user password change.

## 9. Security Design

### 9.1 Authentication

| Aspect           | Implementation                                                                          |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mechanism**    | Supabase Auth — email/password + OAuth (Google, etc.)                                   |
| **Session**      | Supabase JWT, stored in `localStorage`. Auto-refreshed by Supabase client.             |
| **API Auth**     | Every API handler validates `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` via Supabase service client. |
| **Tier Check**   | `validate-session` checks `subscriptions` table for active tier before Tier 2 access.  |

### 9.2 Encryption Layers

| Layer                  | Mechanism                                               |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Transport              | TLS 1.3 (enforced by Vercel and Supabase)               |
| Application (data)     | AES-256-GCM per-record encryption before Supabase write |
| Storage (Supabase)     | Supabase at-rest encryption (AES-256)                   |
| Session (analytics)    | AES-256-GCM encrypted session context per session ID    |

### 9.3 Row-Level Security (Supabase RLS)

All tables have RLS policies enforcing user isolation:

```sql
-- Example RLS policy for records table
CREATE POLICY "Users can only access their own records"
ON records
FOR ALL
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

No query can return data belonging to a different user, regardless of application-level bugs.

### 9.4 HTTP Security Headers

Configured in `vercel.json` for all routes:

| Header                    | Value                              | Purpose                    |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `X-Content-Type-Options`  | `nosniff`                          | Prevent MIME-type sniffing |
| `X-Frame-Options`         | `DENY`                             | Block iframe embedding     |
| `X-XSS-Protection`        | `1; mode=block`                    | Legacy XSS filter          |
| `Referrer-Policy`         | `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`  | Limit referrer leakage     |

API routes additionally:

| Header                          | Value      | Purpose                    |
|---------------------------------|------------|----------------------------|
| `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`   | (origin-scoped in production) | Restrict CORS |
| `Cache-Control`                 | `no-store` | Prevent response caching   |

### 9.5 Known Security Considerations (Migrated from v1.0)

| Item                            | Status in v2.0                                                       | Severity |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Passcode auth replaced          | Replaced by Supabase Auth (JWT). Fully resolved.                     | ✅ Fixed |
| JSONBin master key in repo      | JSONBin replaced by Supabase. `create_bin.js` to be deleted.         | ✅ Fixed |
| Open CORS (`*`)                 | CORS restricted to known origins in production.                       | ✅ Fixed |
| No API auth middleware          | All API handlers now validate Supabase JWT.                           | ✅ Fixed |

## 12. Constraints & Limitations

### 12.1 Technical Constraints

| Constraint                  | Description                                                                                            |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Vercel function timeout**  | Serverless functions: 10s (Hobby) / 60s (Pro). Complex images or large analytics queries may time out. |
| **Gemini context window**    | The analytics assistant context is bounded by Gemini's token limit. Very large datasets need chunking. |
| **No real-time sync**        | The records vault loads data at once. Concurrent edits from multiple devices may conflict.              |
| **No row-level identity**    | Record rows have no primary key. Deduplication is heuristic (≤1 field diff).                           |
| **No offline support**       | No service worker. The app requires connectivity.                                                       |
| **Single-file frontend**     | The records page is a large inline HTML/CSS/JS file. Refactoring needed as analytics complexity grows. |

### 12.2 AI / Extraction Limitations

| Limitation                    | Description                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Handwriting quality**       | Accuracy depends on legibility. Poor handwriting produces nulls or bracketed guesses.            |
| **Schema drift**              | If first uploaded image differs from later pages, headers may diverge. Context mitigates this.   |
| **Non-tabular layouts**       | System assumes tabular pages. Freeform notes or non-standard layouts may confuse the model.      |
| **Language support**          | Prompt is English-only. Non-English logbooks may produce inconsistent results.                   |
| **Analytics depth**           | Complex statistical analysis (regression, ML models) is a roadmap item, not available at launch. |
